# Logasaurus 
Logasurous (loga command) is a command line utility that queries elasticsearch in realtime, so you can tail logs just like you used to. 

## Build & Configure & Run

1. ```go build loga.go```

If you're on OSx I recommend placing the build binary in `/usr/local/bin` or somewhere else in your $PATH. 

#### config.yaml
The config.yaml is located in ```~/.loga/config.yaml```. YOU NEED TO MOVE THE config file to this location, making the dot dir along the way.

Make sure to update the config.yaml with your elasticsearch URI and port assignements.

You can override the config location is `-c` - don't use ~ or other shell expansion, provide the fully qualified path if you use this option.

## Usage

#### Defined query on the CLI:

```loga -d "some_query AND another_query"```

Will return matched messages from the last 10 minutes (see -sd override below) and resync backwards 5 seconds every 5 seconds (see -si override below).

#### Defined service in config.yaml:

```loga -s my_service_name```

Will return the query lookup from 'my_service_name' which should be in the 'define' section of the config.yaml.

loga will present the results from the search as a stream to stdin. Since the query is over standard http sockets, it'll return the query every 1s by default.

## Manpage

**NAME**
  
loga -- query ES logs on the CL

**SYNOPSIS**

loga [-d | --define string] [-i | --intervel time-in-seconds] [-v | --verbose] [-e | --elasticsearch-uri string-uri] [-p | --port elasticsearch-port] [-in | --es-index elasticsearch-index] [-c | --configuration path-to-config]

**DESCRIPTION**

The logasaurous (loga command) utility queries elasticsearch for logs based on a valid elasticsearch query. All requests are made to elasticsearch's REST endpoint over HTTP (HTTPS will be an option down the road). 

Logasaurous maintains a YAML configuration file where you can pre-set service definitions. You can leverage a one-time temporary service definition by using the ```define``` directive on the CLI.  

Many configurations in the config file can be overridden on the CLI as well. 

#### -c | Config 
  Override the default configuration path. Default is ~/.loga.yaml on osx and /etc/loga.yaml on *nix distros. 
  Ex: loga -c /fully/qualified/path/config.yaml

#### -co | Count 
  Override the default count of queries to return. Default is 500.
  Ex: loga -d "some_query" -co 10 # Returns 10 queries from most recent. 

#### -d | Define 
  A temporary service definition. Must be a valid elasticsearch query. Can not be used with -s.
  Ex: loga -d "some_value AND \"a-long-string\""

#### -e | Elasticsearch URL
  Override for `elasticsearch_uri` in config file. Default is localhost.
  Ex: loga -d "some_query" -e my.elastic.com

#### -h | Enable Host Output
  Outputs the hostname for the log message before the message in cyan
  Ex: loga -d "some_query" -h

#### -hl | Highlight Query
  Highlights the string in the message that contains a match to your query. Outputs in yellow.
  Ex: logo -d "some_query" -hl

#### -s | Service Abstraction
  A defined service in the config.yaml. Can not be used with -d.
  Ex: loga -s my_defined_service_in_config_yaml

#### -si | Sync Interval 
  Time in seconds between elasticsearch queries. Default is 5s.
  Ex: loga -d "some_query" -si 10

#### -sd | Sync Depth
  Time in minutes to sync backwards - only affects first sync. Start time is always time.Meow() but this might change. 
  Ex: loga -d "some_query" -sd 120

#### -st | Start Time
  Time in past in minutes to start the search.
  Ex: loga -d "some_query" -st 20 # Starts the search 20 minutes in the past to the sync depth, so a window 30-20 minutes ago if used with defualt sync depth of 10 minutes. It will update itself every 5 seconds by default.

#### -p | Port
  Override for `elasticsearch_port` in config file. Default is 9300.       
  Ex: loga -d "some_query" -p 4500

#### -v | Verbose 
  Verbose output.
  Ex: Figure it out.
